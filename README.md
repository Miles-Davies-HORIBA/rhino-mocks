Rhino Mocks
===========

**Rhino Mocks** is a dynamic mock object framework for the .Net platform.

How To Build
------------

Rhino Mocks is built using [psake](https://github.com/psake/psake). It is important to understand that the standard Visual Studio build process will not work due to missing AssemblyInfo.cs files. This is to ensure the build number is generated correctly.

In order to build this project, execute the [psake](https://github.com/psake/psake) build script from a Powershell console. This can be done using the following command from the root project directory:

*.\psake.ps1 .\default.ps1*

You make need to allow script execution by running the following command as administrator:

*Set-ExecutionPolicy unrestricted*

**The build script assumes *git.exe* is in your PATH**
